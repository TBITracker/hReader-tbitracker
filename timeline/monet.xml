        On the first of April 1851 Monet entered the Le Havre secondary school. 
        He first became known locally for his charcoal caricatures, which he 
        would sell for ten to twenty francs. Monet also undertook his first 
        drawing lessons from Jean-Francois Ochard, a former student of 
        Jacques-Louis David (1748 - 1825). On the beaches of Normandy, he met 
        fellow artist Eugène Boudin, who became his mentor and taught him to 
        use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet en plein air (outdoor) techniques 
        for painting.

        Alice Hoschedé decided to help Monet by bringing up his two children 
        together with her own. They lived in Poissy, which Monet hated. 
        In April 1883 they moved to a house in Giverny, Eure, in Haute-Normandie, 
        where he planted a large garden which he painted for the rest of his life.

        In the 1880s and 1890s, Monet began "series" painting: paintings of 
        one subject in varying light and viewpoints. His first series is of 
        Rouen Cathedral from different points of view and at different times 
        of the day.

        Monet was exceptionally fond of painting controlled nature: his own garden 
        in Giverny, with its water lilies, pond and bridge. He also painted up and 
        down the banks of the Seine.

        Claude Monet made several trips to the Mediterranean between 1883 and 1908. 
        During these visits he painted many landscapes and seascapes such as 
        Bordighera. Famous landmarks were also a favorite subject for Monet in the 
        Mediterranean. His paintings in Venice included the Grand Canal, Doges' Palace, 
        and San Giorgio Maggiore. The Monet painting that was stolen in the movie The 
        Thomas Crown Affair was San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk.

        Monet moved to Giverny, France in 1883. Shortly after his arrival in Giverny, 
        Claude began developing the famous garden that was the inspiration for many 
        of his most famous paintings. The Artist's Garden in Giverny is one of the 
        most popular paintings. His garden in Giverny grew to include a water garden 
        and a japanese style bridge. Water lilies and the Japanese bridge were the subject 
        of many Monet paintings.

        >
        Cataracts formed on his eyes for which he underwent two surgeries in 1923. 
        It is interesting to note that the paintings done while the cataracts affected 
        his vision have a general reddish tone, which is a characteristic of the vision 
        of cataract victims. It may also be that after his surgery, he was now able to 
        see certain ultraviolet wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the 
        lens of the eye; this may have had an effect on the colors he perceived. After 
        his operations he even repainted some of these paintings.

        Monet died December 5, 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the Giverny 
        church cemetery. His famous home and garden with its waterlily pond and bridge 
        at Giverny are a popular drawcard for tourists. In the house there are many 
        examples of Japanese woodcut prints on the walls.
